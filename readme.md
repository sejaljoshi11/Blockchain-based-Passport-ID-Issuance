# Blockchain-based Passport/ID Issuance

## Project Description
A decentralized identity management system that leverages blockchain to securely issue, store, and verify digital passports or IDs. It ensures transparency, immutability, and easy verification of identity credentials.

## Project Vision
To create a tamper-proof, globally accessible digital identity system using blockchain, reducing fraud and enhancing trust in official identity documents.

## Key Features
- *Decentralized Identity Storage*: Digital IDs are stored securely on the blockchain.
- *Verified Issuance*: Only authorized administrators can issue passports or IDs.
- *Public Verification*: Any user can verify the authenticity of an ID on-chain.

## Future Scope
- *ID Revocation
 and Update Features*: Add the ability to revoke or renew digital IDs.
- *Biometric Data Integration*: Include hashes of biometric information for added security.
- *Cross-border Recognition*: Build systems for international verification and interoperability.
- *Mobile/Web Interface*: Create a user-friendly dApp for governments and citizens.
